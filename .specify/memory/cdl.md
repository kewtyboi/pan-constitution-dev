# Constitution Decision Log (CDL)

This log records decisions **about the Pan Constitution itself** (distinct from ADRs which are about project decisions).

### CDL-001: Manual Constitution Update Process Deviation

**Decision**: Updated Pan Constitution to v1.1.1 and deleted non-functional workflow file via direct commits rather than following prescribed constitutional workflow.

**Context**: 
- The automated update workflow (`.github/workflows/update-pan.yml`) was too long and not working properly
- Constitution setup is in early stages - required infrastructure files (PR template, profile.yaml, CDL) didn't exist yet
- Changes were primarily cosmetic formatting fixes (smart quotes to straight quotes, em dashes to regular dashes)

**Rationale**:
- Workflow file was causing more problems than solving
- Manual approach was necessary to establish the constitutional infrastructure
- Formatting improvements were needed for consistency

**Standards Affected**: A6 (Order of operations), T1 (Linkage), T3 (AI provenance), T4 (CHANGELOG lifecycle)

**Lessons Learned**:
- Need to create constitutional infrastructure files before implementing automated workflows
- Workflows should be simpler and more focused
- Manual process deviation should be documented in CDL as required by Standard T2

**Status**: Resolved - Infrastructure files now created, proper process established for future updates
