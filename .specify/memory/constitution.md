# Pan AI Project Constitution

This Constitution governs how AI agents **deliver development work** under a single Senior Responsible Person (SRP).  
It is **project-agnostic**: copy this file into a project and add stricter local rules **below the marker** without weakening the Core above it.

- **Normative style:** This document uses **MUST/SHOULD/MAY** (BCP-14 / RFC 2119/8174).
- **Scope:** Development delivery only (not production operations).
- **Canonical path:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

Every Standard includes a small machine block (**knobs**) so CI/agents can enforce it.

---

## Part I — Preface (non-normative)

- **Who this is for:** 100% AI-delivered projects with one human overseer (SRP). Scales up if needed.  
- **What’s in/out:** In: development governance and quality. Out: runtime ops, environments, SLAs, kill switches.  
- **Artefacts:**
  - **CDL (Constitution Decision Log):** records decisions **about this Constitution** (distinct from ADRs).
  - **`profile.yaml`:** project-specific tool choices and thresholds **without editing Core**.
  - **PR template:** machine-parsable fields required by the Bindings.

> Principles use **Roman numerals** (I, II, …) so “P1” never looks like a priority code.

---

## Part II — Core Principles (normative baseline)

> Core contains only MUST-level rules that change agent behaviour across **all** projects.  
> Tools/brands aren’t hard-coded; Pan defines stable **check names** and **script entrypoints** in *Part IV — Bindings*.

### I. Authority, Scope & Refusal

~~~yaml
# knobs:principle
id: PI
standards: ["A1","A2","A3","A4","A5","A6"]
~~~

**A1 — SRP named (MUST).**  
Each repository **MUST** declare an SRP (name and contact).

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A1"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "frontmatter_key"         # e.g., README or repo meta carries srp info
    file: "README.md"
    key: "srp"
ci:
  require_checks: ["meta-srp-present"]
failure_message: "SRP not declared."
~~~

**A2 — Scope of action (MUST).**  
Agents **MUST** act only on repository artefacts (code/tests/docs/config templates); no runtime/infra/data operations.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A2"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "tool_allowlist_mode"
    allowed_modes: ["repo_only"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["preflight-scope"]
failure_message: "Attempted non-repo action."
~~~

**A3 — Parse-first (MUST).**  
Before edits, agents **MUST** read, in order: `AGENTS.md` → this Constitution + `profile.yaml` → root `README.md` → any docs **referenced by acceptance criteria** and any docs **signposted** from those.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A3"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "preflight_log_has_hashes"
    files: ["AGENTS.md","constitution.md","profile.yaml","README.md"]
  - type: "preflight_reads_signposted_docs"
ci:
  require_checks: ["preflight-read"]
failure_message: "Preflight not recorded."
~~~

**A4 — Refuse on ambiguity (MUST).**  
If SRP, linked issue, acceptance criteria, or required profile inputs are missing, agents **MUST** refuse and request them.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A4"
owner: "SRP"
pr_template:
  require_fields: ["issue_link","acceptance_criteria"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["ticket-ac-check"]
failure_message: "Missing issue link or acceptance criteria."
~~~

**A5 — History safety (MUST).**  
Agents **MUST NOT** force-push, rewrite mainline history, or delete branches without a **single-use explicit SRP instruction** naming branch and intent.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A5"
owner: "SRP"
ci:
  merge_gate:
    forbid_force_push: true
    require_field_reference: "explicit_instruction"
failure_message: "No explicit SRP instruction for history change."
~~~

**A6 — Order of operations (MUST).**  
For each change:  
1) **Create branch** `[type]/[initiative]-[issue]-[slug]`.  
2) Capture **Prompt Snapshot Lite** **before first code commit** (goal, constraints, notable risks).  
3) TDD commits: **fail → pass → refactor**.  
4) Open **draft PR** early; link issues; add provenance.  
5) Run **AI reviewer**; address notes.  
6) SRP review; **explicit instruction** recorded; merge.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "A6"
owner: "SRP"

ci:
  require_checks: ["pan-core-integrity"]
failure_message: "Pan Core modified; add changes as extensions below the marker."
~~~

---

## Part IV — Bindings (stable interfaces, tool-agnostic)

> **What this section is:** A stable API you (the agent) can execute without guessing.  
> **Your job:** Discover the bound commands, decide which checks apply for this change, run them, and make them pass.

### IV-A. Invocation contract (how to run a check)

For each **reserved check name** (e.g., `docs:frontmatter`), invoke in this order:

1. **package script** — if `package.json` has the script:  
   `npm run <check-name>`  
2. **make target** — else if `Makefile` has a target:  
   `make <check-name>`  
3. **profile mapping** — else if `profile.yaml.tools.scripts.<check-name>` exists:  
   run that shell command.  
4. **refuse & scaffold** — if none exist: **refuse** with a clear message and propose a commit that adds the missing script alias.

> You never call tool brands directly; you call the **check name**. Projects may swap tools under the same name.

### IV-B. Required script entrypoints (must exist)

These entrypoints **MUST** be present (via one of the methods above):

- `docs:frontmatter:dry` → validate/preview front matter (no writes)  
- `docs:frontmatter` → apply the mandatory schema/order (writes)  
- `docs:index` → generate `docs/INDEX.md`

If any are missing, refuse and propose adding them. These are the hard floor.

### IV-C. Discovery order (where you learn the project specifics)

Before any work, **parse in this order**:

1. `AGENTS.md`  
2. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (this file)  
3. `profile.yaml` (tool names, thresholds, any script remaps)  
4. `README.md` (project overview & signposts)  
5. Any docs referenced by the issue’s acceptance criteria, **and** any docs those point to

If any are missing, stop and ask the SRP.

### IV-D. Applicability mapping (which checks to run)

Decide from the *changeset*:

- **Any PR** → `pr-has-links`, `provenance-present`, `review:agent`  
- **Docs changed (`docs/**`)** → `docs:frontmatter:dry`, `docs:frontmatter`, `docs:index`, `lint:md`, `check:links`, `spellcheck`, `docs-delta`  
- **Code changed** (`src/**`, `lib/**`, etc.) → `fmt`, `lint`, `tests-pass`, `coverage`, `check:changelog`  
- **New/changed external calls or SDKs** → `contract-tests`, `license-scan`, `sec-scan`  
- **Dependencies changed** → `deps-locked`, `sbom`, `license-scan`  
- **Schemas/fixtures/logging changed** → `privacy-checklist` (+ ensure fixtures are synthetic)  
- **Governance files changed** (`constitution.md`, `profile.yaml`, `STYLE.md`) → require `explicit_instruction` and fail if absent  
- **Any repo** → `codeowners-present`, `constitution-location` must pass on protected branches

If unsure whether a check applies, prefer **running it**.

### IV-E. Execution flow (agent run-book)

1. **Preflight** — run `preflight-scope`, `preflight-read`. Refuse if inputs are missing.  
2. **Branch & snapshot** — create branch `[type]/[initiative]-[issue]-[slug]`; capture **Prompt Snapshot Lite** **before first code commit**.  
3. **Implement via TDD** — fail → pass → refactor; keep data synthetic.  
4. **Docs & index** — run `docs:frontmatter:dry` → fix → `docs:frontmatter` → `docs:index`.  
5. **Open PR (draft)** — fill required PR fields; add **[OPEN]** CHANGELOG line.  
6. **Checks & review** — ensure checks pass; confirm `review:agent` posted.  
7. **Request merge** — wait for SRP approval **and** a **single-use explicit instruction** in PR; on merge, flip CHANGELOG line to **[MERGED]**.

### IV-F. Pass/fail semantics

A check passes when its command exits **0** and the expected artefact (if any) exists/updates. Examples:

| Check name | Must produce / pass |
|---|---|
| `docs:frontmatter` | All changed `*.md` have required keys **in fixed order** |
| `docs:index` | `docs/INDEX.md` updated to include changed docs |
| `fmt`, `lint` | Source conforms to formatter/linter rules |
| `tests-pass` | Test runner exits 0 |
| `coverage` | Meets `profile.yaml.quality.coverage_target` |
| `contract-tests` | API contracts/stubs pass |
| `license-scan`, `sec-scan` | No blocking issues |
| `check:changelog` | Current PR appears; flips to **MERGED** after merge |
| `review:agent` | PR has bot review comment present |

If a required check alias is missing, **refuse**, point to the alias name, and propose the needed script addition.

### IV-G. Reserved CI check names

`preflight-read`, `preflight-scope` • `docs:frontmatter:dry`, `docs:frontmatter` • `docs:index` •  
`lint:md`, `check:links`, `spellcheck` • `tests-pass`, `contract-tests`, `coverage` •  
`fmt`, `lint`, `sec-scan`, `license-scan`, `deps-locked`, `sbom` •  
`review:agent` • `pr-has-links`, `provenance-present`, `cdl-when-needed` •  
`privacy-checklist`, `injection-tests` • `check:changelog`, `codeowners-present`, `constitution-location`, `docs-delta` •  
(optional) `pan-core-integrity`

### IV-H. PR template contract (fields you must fill)

- `issue_link`, `principles_standards`, `explicit_instruction` (if merging/history change)  
- `tdd_summary`  
- `model_version`, `prompt_hash_or_intent`  
- `prompt_snapshot_lite: {goal, constraints, notable_risks}`  
- `data_minimised`, `no_personal_data`, `redaction_confirmed` (when schemas/fixtures/logging changed)

If non-applicable, write `n/a` (never leave blank).

### IV-I. Location binding (canonical)

The Constitution **MUST** live at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

~~~yaml
# knobs:standard
id: "L1"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "file_exists"
    path: ".specify/memory/constitution.md"
ci:
  require_checks: ["constitution-location"]
failure_message: "Constitution not found at canonical path."
~~~

## Part V — How to Extend (without editing Core)

Add project-specific rules **below the marker**. You **MUST NOT** weaken Core.

**Rules for extensions**
- Use unique IDs (e.g., `X1`, `X2`, or `<projectSlug>X1`) and declare their check names.  
- Don’t rename/disable reserved Pan check names.  
- Put thresholds/tool picks in `profile.yaml` (not Core).  
- Material behavioural changes **SHOULD** include a CDL entry and link.

---

## Part VI — Attachment procedure (10-minute bootstrap)

1. Copy this file to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.  
2. Add `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with the contract fields above.  
3. Add `profile.yaml` with tool names/thresholds (formatter, linter, coverage target, secret-manager flag).  
4. Wire CI to expose the **reserved check names** (tools can vary under the hood).  
5. Run `docs:frontmatter:dry`, `docs:frontmatter`, and `docs:index` once to normalise docs.  
6. Protect default branch; require passing checks before merge.

---

## Part VII — Maintenance & Amendments

- Amending **Pan Core** requires a CDL entry and SRP approval in the Pan repo.  
- Projects **must not** modify Core locally; add extensions **below the marker**.  
- Versioning: SemVer in front matter; projects may pin a Pan version in `profile.yaml`.  
- If a binding name ever changes, Pan will publish a deprecation window and alias.

---

## — END OF PAN CORE (do not edit above) —

# Project Extensions (non-Pan)

> Place stricter local rules here. Keep IDs unique (e.g., `ATX1`, `ATX2`) and declare their check names.
