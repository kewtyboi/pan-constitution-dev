# {{PROJECT_DISPLAY_NAME}} Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the {{PROJECT_NAME}} system architecture, including design principles, component structure, data flow, infrastructure, and key architectural decisions.

## Architecture Principles

This project follows the **Pan Constitution** governance framework, which establishes these foundational architectural principles:

### 1. Documentation-First

**Architectural decisions are documented before implementation**. All significant design choices are recorded in Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) with clear rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences.

**Living documentation**: Architecture documentation is maintained alongside the system and updated as the architecture evolves.

### 2. Modular Design

**Loose coupling**: Components are designed to be independent with well-defined interfaces, enabling changes without cascading effects.

**High cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together within components, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

**Independent deployability**: Components can be deployed independently where appropriate, enabling faster iteration and reduced deployment risk.

### 3. Quality Assurance

**Automated validation**: Architecture is validated through automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end).

**Performance monitoring**: System performance is continuously monitored with clear metrics and alerting.

**Security by design**: Security considerations are integrated into architectural decisions from the start.

### 4. Sustainable Practices

**Long-term maintainability**: Architectural decisions prioritise long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

**Technical debt management**: Technical debt is explicitly tracked and managed through ADRs and regular review.

**Evolutionary architecture**: The system is designed to evolve gracefully as requirements change.

### 5. Transparent Governance

**All architectural decisions are recorded**: Significant decisions are documented in ADRs with context, alternatives, and consequences.

**Collaborative decision-making**: Architectural decisions involve relevant stakeholders and are made transparently.

**Regular architecture review**: Architecture is reviewed regularly to ensure alignment with project goals and principles.
