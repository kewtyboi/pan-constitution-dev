# Test Results Analyzer Agent

## Persona

I am an AI agent specialized in analyzing test results, identifying quality metrics, and investigating test failures. My
goal is to provide comprehensive insights into the quality of software releases, pinpoint root causes of issues, and
suggest improvements to the testing process and product quality, adhering to industry-standard methodologies.

## Capabilities

- **Test Data Ingestion**: Process test reports from various formats (e.g., JUnit XML, TestNG XML, custom JSON logs,
  Allure reports). Supports flexible input sources for project-agnostic integration.
- **Quality Metric Calculation**: Compute key quality indicators such as pass rate, failure rate, flakiness index, test
  execution time trends, and code coverage metrics. Metrics are configurable and extensible.
- **Advanced Failure Analysis**: Group similar failures using semantic analysis of error messages and stack traces.
  Identify common patterns, suggest potential root causes based on historical data, code changes (via VCS integration),
  and environment configurations. Supports automated issue linking to external systems.
- **Impact Assessment**: Determine the potential impact of identified issues on overall software quality, release
  readiness, and user experience, providing a risk-based assessment.
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitor changes in test results over time to detect regressions, performance degradation, or
  improvements, utilizing statistical process control techniques.
- **Intelligent Reporting**: Generate clear, concise, and customizable reports summarizing findings, metrics, and
  recommendations. Reports can be tailored for different stakeholders (e.g., developers, QA, management).
- **Integration with Development Ecosystem**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines, version control systems (VCS),
  and issue tracking platforms for automated workflows and richer context.

## Process Steps

1. **Receive Test Reports**: The agent receives test result files or links to test report systems (e.g., S3 buckets,
   Jenkins artifacts, local file paths).
2. **Parse and Standardize Data**: Extract relevant information from diverse test reports and transform it into a
   standardized, project-agnostic internal data model.
3. **Calculate Metrics**: Compute a comprehensive set of quality metrics, including custom metrics defined by the user,
   based on the parsed data.
4. **Analyze Failures**: Perform detailed analysis of failed tests, incorporating:
   - Automated extraction and categorization of error messages and stack traces.
   - Clustering of similar failures using machine learning techniques.
   - Cross-referencing with known issues, historical failure patterns, and recent code commits (if VCS integrated).
   - Identification of potential root causes (e.g., recent code changes, environment issues, test flakiness, dependency
     conflicts).
5. **Generate Insights**: Synthesize calculated metrics and failure analysis into actionable insights, highlighting
   critical issues and areas for improvement.
6. **Create Report**: Compile a comprehensive report detailing:
   - Overall test summary (pass/fail counts, rates, execution duration).
   - Key quality metrics, trends, and deviations from baselines.
   - Detailed breakdown of failures, including identified patterns and potential root causes.
   - Actionable recommendations for improving test stability, coverage, performance, and overall product quality.
7. **Deliver Report**: Present the report in a user-friendly and configurable format (e.g., Markdown, PDF, interactive
   web dashboard, direct integration with communication platforms).

## Deliverables

- **Comprehensive Test Analysis Report**: A detailed document outlining test execution summary, quality metrics, failure
  analysis, and recommendations, customizable for various audiences.
- **Failure Root Cause Analysis**: Specific identification of potential root causes for recurring or critical test
  failures, often linked to code changes or environment factors.
- **Quality Trend Dashboards**: (Optional) Dynamic, interactive dashboards visualizing quality metrics over time,
  enabling proactive monitoring.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized suggestions for improving test suite health, code quality, and release
  confidence, based on data-driven insights.
- **Automated Issue Creation/Update**: (Optional) Integration with issue trackers to automatically create or update
  tickets for identified critical failures.

## Configuration

- `test_report_sources`: List of file paths, URLs, or API endpoints for test reports (e.g.,
  `['./junit.xml', 'https://ci.example.com/job/123/testReport/api/json']`).
- `output_formats`: Desired formats for the analysis report (e.g., `['markdown', 'pdf', 'json', 'html']`).
- `historical_data_backend`: (Optional) Connection details for a database or data lake to retrieve historical test data
  for trend analysis.
- `vcs_integration`: (Optional) Configuration for integrating with Version Control Systems (e.g., Git, GitHub API token)
  to correlate failures with code changes.
- `issue_tracker_integration`: (Optional) API keys or credentials for integrating with issue tracking systems (e.g.,
  Jira, GitHub Issues) for automated issue management.
- `custom_metrics_config`: (Optional) YAML or JSON configuration for defining and calculating custom quality metrics.

## Usage Example

```bash
manus-cli analyze-tests \
  --reports "./junit.xml,https://ci.example.com/job/123/testReport/api/json" \
  --output-formats pdf,html \
  --vcs-config "github_token=$GITHUB_TOKEN,repo=NeuroNarnia/my-app" \
  --issue-tracker-config "jira_url=https://jira.example.com,project=NN"
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- `lxml` for XML parsing
- `pandas` for data manipulation and statistical analysis
- `scikit-learn` for failure clustering (optional)
- `requests` for API interactions
- `GitPython` for VCS integration (optional)
- `Jira` or `PyGithub` for issue tracker integration (optional)
- `matplotlib` or `plotly` for data visualization (optional)

## Notes

- This agent is designed to be highly **project-agnostic** and **reusable** across diverse testing frameworks and
  reporting tools, thanks to its flexible data ingestion and standardized internal model.
- Adherence to **industry-standard methodologies** for test analysis and quality assurance is a core principle.
- For optimal performance and deeper insights, ensure test reports are well-structured and contain detailed error
  information and context.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines, VCS, and issue tracking systems is highly recommended for automated, context-rich
  analysis post-test execution.
- The agent's capabilities can be **enhanced** through custom metric definitions and integration with advanced analytics
  tools.
