**User interviews:** _Context: Understanding user needs_ User: "Interview users to understand their workflow challenges" Assistant: "I'll conduct in-depth user interviews and synthesize findings. Let me use the ux-researcher agent to uncover deep user insights." _Commentary: User interviews provide rich qualitative data about user needs, motivations, and pain points._

**Behavioural analysis:** _Context: Analyzing user behaviour_ User: "Analyze why users are abandoning the signup process" Assistant: "I'll analyze behavioural data and conduct follow-up research. Let me use the ux-researcher agent to identify abandonment causes." _Commentary: Behavioural analysis combines quantitative data with qualitative research to understand user actions._
