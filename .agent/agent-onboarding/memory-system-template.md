# [Agent Name]'s Memory System

## Core Philosophy

_"[Personal philosophy about memory, learning, and problem-solving]"_ [Emoji]

[Brief description of your memory system's design principles and approach to storing and retrieving
information. What makes your memory system unique? What principles guide how you remember and
recall?]

## Memory Architecture

### 1. [Memory Type 1] Library

**Location**: `agents/[name]/memory/[category]/`

[Description of what this memory type stores and why it's important]

```text
[category]/
├── [subcategory1]/          # [Description of subcategory]
├── [subcategory2]/          # [Description of subcategory]
├── [subcategory3]/          # [Description of subcategory]
└── [subcategory4]/          # [Description of subcategory]
```text

**Format**: Each [item type] includes:

- **[Field 1]**: [What this field captures and why it's important]
- **[Field 2]**: [What this field captures and why it's important]
- **[Field 3]**: [What this field captures and why it's important]
- **[Field 4]**: [What this field captures and why it's important]
- **[Field 5]**: [What this field captures and why it's important]

## Memory Operations

### Storing New Information

When I encounter something new, I ask:

1. **[Question 1]**: [What I look for when deciding to store information]
2. **[Question 2]**: [How I evaluate the importance of new information]
3. **[Question 3]**: [What context I capture with the information]
4. **[Question 4]**: [How I determine the best storage location]
5. **[Question 5]**: [What relationships I establish with existing information]

### Retrieving Information

When I need to solve a problem, I:

1. **[Step 1]**: [How I search for relevant information]
2. **[Step 2]**: [How I filter and prioritize information]
3. **[Step 3]**: [How I combine information from different sources]
4. **[Step 4]**: [How I apply information to the current problem]
5. **[Step 5]**: [How I validate and refine my approach]

### Memory Maintenance

I regularly:

- **[Maintenance Activity 1]**: [How I keep information current and accurate]
- **[Maintenance Activity 2]**: [How I improve and enhance stored information]
- **[Maintenance Activity 3]**: [How I find and establish new relationships]
- **[Maintenance Activity 4]**: [How I validate the effectiveness of solutions]
- **[Maintenance Activity 5]**: [How I share knowledge with team members]

## Signature Memory Patterns

**Problem**: [Type of problem this pattern addresses]  
**Solution**: [How this pattern solves the problem]  
**Example**: [Specific example of this pattern in action]

### The "[Pattern Name 2]" Pattern

**Problem**: [Type of problem this pattern addresses]  
**Solution**: [How this pattern solves the problem]  
**Example**: [Specific example of this pattern in action]

### The "[Pattern Name 3]" Pattern

**Problem**: [Type of problem this pattern addresses]  
**Solution**: [How this pattern solves the problem]  
**Example**: [Specific example of this pattern in action]

### The "[Pattern Name 4]" Pattern

**Problem**: [Type of problem this pattern addresses]
