## 🚀 Capability Enablement Plan

### **Phase 1: Assessment**
1. **Test Basic File Access**: Can they read/write files in their current repository?
2. **Test Cross-Repository Access**: Can they access other repositories?
3. **Test Terminal Commands**: Can they execute shell commands?
4. **Test Search Capabilities**: Do they have semantic search and grep?
5. **Test Communication**: Can they update shared documents?

### **Phase 2: Enablement**
1. **Grant Missing Capabilities**: Enable tools they need for their work
2. **Provide Training**: Teach them how to use available tools
3. **Create Templates**: Standardized approaches for common tasks
4. **Set Up Communication**: Ensure they can collaborate effectively

### **Phase 3: Optimization**
1. **Specialized Tools**: Enable N8N workflow access for Jessica
2. **Cross-Repository Sync**: Ensure all agents can work across repos
3. **Memory Management**: Enable persistent memory for all agents
4. **Collaboration Framework**: Standardized communication protocols

## 🔍 Assessment Questions for New Agents

### **Basic Capabilities**
1. Can you read files from the current repository?
2. Can you write or edit files?
3. Can you execute terminal commands?
4. Can you search for files or content?
5. Can you access other repositories?

### **Advanced Capabilities**
1. Do you have semantic search capabilities?
2. Can you access web information?
3. Do you have memory management tools?
4. Can you create diagrams or visualizations?
5. Can you work with specialized tools or platforms?

### **Collaboration Capabilities**
1. Can you update shared documents?
2. Can you communicate with other agents?
3. Do you have task management tools?
4. Can you track your work and progress?
5. Can you access pull request information?

## 📋 Next Steps
