# ADR-004: Place INDEX.md at Project Root

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Deciders:** Pan Governance Team  
**Technical Story:** Epic #5, Scaffolding #8

## Context and Problem Statement

The Pan Constitution template needs an auto-generated index of all documentation. We need to decide where to place this index file:

1. At project root (`/INDEX.md`)
2. In docs directory (`/docs/INDEX.md`)
3. As part of README.md

The index serves both humans and AI agents who need to quickly find documentation.

## Decision Drivers

- **Visibility:** Index should be immediately discoverable
- **Convention:** Should follow standard practices where they exist
- **Separation:** Should not clutter root directory unnecessarily
- **Automation:** Should be easy to auto-generate and update
- **AI-Friendly:** AI agents should easily find and parse it

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Place in docs/ Directory

**Approach:** Create `/docs/INDEX.md` alongside other documentation.

**Pros:**
- Keeps documentation together
- Cleaner root directory
- Logical location (index of docs in docs/)

**Cons:**
- Less visible to users
- Not immediately discoverable
- AI agents may not check docs/ first
- Not standard practice for project-level indexes

**Implementation Effort:** Low

### Option 2: Place at Project Root (CHOSEN)

**Approach:** Create `/INDEX.md` at project root.

**Pros:**
- **Immediately visible** to users and AI agents
- **Standard practice** for project-level indexes
- **Clear intent** - top-level index of all documentation
- **Easy to find** - no need to navigate into docs/
- **Follows examples** from mature projects

**Cons:**
- Adds one more file to root directory
- Could be confused with README.md

**Implementation Effort:** Low

### Option 3: Integrate into README.md

**Approach:** Add documentation index section to README.md.

**Pros:**
- No additional file
- Single entry point

**Cons:**
- README.md becomes very long
- Mixes project overview with documentation index
- Harder to auto-generate (must preserve other content)
- Not standard practice

**Implementation Effort:** Medium (complex automation)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: "Place at Project Root"** because it:

1. **Provides immediate visibility** to all users and AI agents
2. **Follows standard practice** for project-level indexes
3. **Clearly signals intent** - this is the master documentation index
4. **Simplifies automation** - standalone file is easy to regenerate
5. **Separates concerns** - README for project overview, INDEX for documentation navigation

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Create INDEX.md (Week 1)**
1. Create `/INDEX.md` at project root
2. Add YAML front matter
3. Add header explaining purpose
4. Include placeholder for auto-generated content

**Phase 2: Auto-Generation Script (Week 2)**
5. Create `scripts/generate-docs-index-v2.js`
6. Scan all documentation files
7. Extract YAML front matter
8. Generate organized index by:
   - Topic
   - Initiative
   - Status
   - Recent updates

**Phase 3: Integration (Week 2)**
9. Add npm script: `npm run docs:index`
10. Document in CONTRIBUTING.md
11. Add to CI/CD validation
12. Link from README.md

### Positive Consequences

- **Immediate discoverability:** Users find index right away
- **Clear navigation:** Single source of truth for all documentation
- **AI-friendly:** Agents can quickly scan all available docs
- **Easy automation:** Standalone file is simple to regenerate
- **Standard practice:** Follows conventions from other projects

### Negative Consequences

- **Root directory clutter:** Adds one more file to root
- **Potential confusion:** Users might confuse with README.md

### Mitigation Strategies

**For root directory clutter:**
- INDEX.md serves important purpose (worth the space)
- Root directory already has multiple files (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, etc.)
- Clear naming makes purpose obvious

**For potential confusion:**
- Clear header in INDEX.md explaining purpose
- Link from README.md to INDEX.md
- Different content makes distinction clear

## INDEX.md Structure

```markdown

topic: documentation-index
name: Documentation Index
author: Auto-generated
version: 1.0.0

To regenerate this index, run:

npm run docs:index
```

## Comparison with Other Projects

| Project | INDEX Location | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| NeuroNarnia | ✅ `/docs/INDEX.md` | In docs/ directory |
| AwayTomate | ❌ None | No index file |
| Pointy-agents | ❌ None | No index file |
| **Pan Template** | ✅ `/INDEX.md` | **At root (our decision)** |

**Observation:** NeuroNarnia has INDEX in docs/, but we believe root is better for visibility.

## Integration with README.md

README.md should link to INDEX.md:

```markdown
## Documentation

For a complete index of all documentation, see [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).

Quick links:
- [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started/)
- [How-to Guides](./docs/how-to/)
- [Reference](./docs/reference/)
```

## Auto-Generation

INDEX.md is **auto-generated** by `scripts/generate-docs-index-v2.js`:

**Inputs:**
- All markdown files in `docs/`
- YAML front matter from each file

**Outputs:**
- Organized index by topic, initiative, status
- Recent updates section
- Alphabetical listings

**Trigger:**
- Manual: `npm run docs:index`
- CI/CD: On PR to validate index is up-to-date
- Pre-commit hook: Optional
