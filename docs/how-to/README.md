# How-to Guides

Welcome to the **How-to Guides** section. This section provides practical, step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks within the Pan Constitution Template framework.

## How to Use This Section

These guides are goal-oriented and assume you have a basic understanding of the template. Unlike tutorials, they are not meant to be read from start to finish. Instead, use them as a reference when you need to perform a specific action, such as adding a new agent or customizing the template.
