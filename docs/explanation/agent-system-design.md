# Agent System Design

This document outlines the design and architecture of the AI agent system integrated into the Pan Constitution Template. The system is engineered to facilitate seamless collaboration between multiple AI agents, ensuring they can work together effectively and efficiently on a project.

## Core Design Philosophy

The agent system is built on a philosophy of **structured autonomy**. Agents are autonomous in their ability to perform tasks, but they operate within a structured framework that ensures their actions are aligned with project goals, constitutional principles, and team protocols. The design is heavily influenced by the successful agent onboarding system from the `pointy-agents` project, as documented in [ADR-002](./../decisions/adr/ADR-002-pointy-agents-template-adoption.md).

Key design goals include:

- **Scalability**: The system is designed to support a single agent or a large team of agents with diverse roles.
- **Clarity**: All agent interactions and responsibilities are clearly defined to prevent ambiguity.
- **Traceability**: Every agent action is auditable and linked to specific project requirements.
- **Extensibility**: The system can be easily extended with new agent roles and capabilities.

## System Components

The agent system is organized into a clear directory structure located at `.agent/`. This directory contains all the necessary components for managing the agent workforce.

| Component               | Path                          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent Hub**           | `.agent/agent-hub/`           | The central communication channel for all agents to coordinate, post updates, and request assistance.         |
| **Agent Onboarding**    | `.agent/agent-onboarding/`    | A comprehensive set of templates and guides to onboard new agents quickly and consistently.                   |
| **Agent Role Profiles** | `.agent/agent-role-profiles/` | A collection of pre-defined profiles that specify the purpose, skills, and guidelines for various agent roles. |
| **Agent Prompts**       | `.agent/agent-prompt/`        | Custom prompts designed for integration with IDEs like Cursor and Codex to enhance developer productivity.    |

### Agent Hub

The **Agent Hub** (`.agent/agent-hub/agent-communication.md`) is the social and coordination layer of the agent system. It serves as a shared log where agents can:

- **Introduce themselves** when joining the project.
- **Post handoff notes** when completing a task or going offline.
- **Request help** from other agents when they encounter a blocker.

This centralized communication channel ensures that all agents have visibility into the team's activities, reducing the risk of duplicated effort and facilitating collaboration.

### Agent Onboarding

A new agent's first experience with the project is through the **onboarding process**. The template adopts the comprehensive 6-template system from `pointy-agents`, which provides a structured path for new agents to get up to speed. The onboarding process includes:

- An **onboarding guide** with step-by-step instructions.
- Templates for defining an agent's **personality**, **memory system**, and **operational context** (e.g., current projects, recent insights).

This structured approach ensures that every agent, regardless of its role, starts with a consistent and complete understanding of the project and its own responsibilities.

### Agent Role Profiles

**Role Profiles** are the functional core of the agent system. Each profile, located in `.agent/agent-role-profiles/`, is a Markdown file that defines a specific role, such as `ai-engineer`, `technical-writer`, or `qa-engineer`.

A role profile specifies:

- The **purpose** and primary goal of the agent.
- The **skills and capabilities** required for the role.
- **Operational guidelines**, including expected inputs and outputs.
- **Collaboration protocols**, defining how the agent interacts with other team members.

This clear definition of roles ensures that every agent has a precise mandate, minimizing confusion and maximizing effectiveness.

## Agent Collaboration Model

The agent system is designed to support a collaborative model where agents work together to achieve common goals. This is facilitated by several key mechanisms:

- **Shared `AGENTS.md`**: A root-level document that provides a high-level overview of the agent system and links to all essential resources.
- **Conventional Commits**: Agents are expected to use conventional commit messages, which provides a clear and machine-readable history of all changes.
- **CI/CD Integration**: The template includes CI/CD workflows that automatically validate agent contributions, ensuring they adhere to project standards.

## Conclusion

The agent system in the Pan Constitution Template is a sophisticated yet straightforward framework for managing an AI workforce. By providing clear structures for communication, onboarding, and role definition, it enables a highly effective and scalable model for AI-driven software development. The system is designed to be both robust and flexible, providing a solid foundation that can be adapted to the unique needs of any project.
