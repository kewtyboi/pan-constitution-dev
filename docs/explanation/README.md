# Explanation

Welcome to the **Explanation** section. This section provides in-depth explanations of the core concepts, architecture, and design decisions behind the Pan Constitution Template.

## How to Use This Section

This section is for users who want to gain a deeper understanding of *why* the template is designed the way it is. The documents here explore the underlying principles and rationale. They are best read when you want to understand the bigger picture, rather than how to perform a specific task.
