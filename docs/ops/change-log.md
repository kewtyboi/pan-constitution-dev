# Pan Constitution Change Log

## v1.0.0 - 2025-10-11

**Status:** Ratified  
**Initiative:** pan-governance-foundation

### Added

- Pan Constitution v1.0.0 with seven core principles
- Constitutional Authority principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Initiative-Based Organization principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- AI Agent Coordination Framework principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Documentation-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Test-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Human Oversight and Approval principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Plain Language and Traceability principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Project-specific extension guidelines

- README.md with project overview and quick start
- AGENTS.md with agent coordination guidelines
- Change log (this file)

### Context

The Pan Constitution was created to provide a consistent governance framework for all AI-agent-built projects. It extracts universal principles from the NeuroNarnia and AwayTomate projects, providing a baseline that all projects can inherit and extend.

The constitution is designed to be:
- **Universal** - Applies to all AI-agent-built projects
- **Flexible** - Projects extend with project-specific requirements
- **Explicit** - Clear, unambiguous language for AI agents
- **Traceable** - All decisions linked to documented principles
- **Enforceable** - Validation gates and human oversight

### Migration Notes

Projects adopting Pan Constitution v1.0.0 should:
1. Refactor their constitution to separate Pan-inherited and project-specific sections
2. Update `.specify/rules/*.mdc` files to use Pan + Project structure
3. Ensure all documentation uses enhanced YAML front matter
4. Implement universal file structure
5. Follow universal development workflow

### Known Limitations

- Pan-wide orchestrator rules (`.specify/rules/*.mdc`) not yet defined
- Pan-wide templates (`.specify/templates/*.md`) not yet defined
- Validation tools and scripts not yet implemented
- Migration guides for existing projects not yet written

These will be addressed in future releases.
