- Epic and story structure for template repository implementation (#5)
- GitHub issues created for all 16 implementation stories (#6-#21)
- Two-repository architecture design (dev + template)
- Bootstrap script specification for project setup
- Complete file inventory from NeuroNarnia and AwayTomate

### Documentation

- Added `docs/analysis/template-repository-comprehensive-analysis.md`
- Added `docs/ops/template-repository-epic-structure.md`

## v1.0.0 - 2025-10-11

**Status:** Ratified  
**Initiative:** pan-governance-foundation

### Added

- Pan Constitution v1.0.0 with seven core principles
- Constitutional Authority principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Initiative-Based Organization principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- AI Agent Coordination Framework principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Documentation-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Test-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Human Oversight and Approval principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Plain Language and Traceability principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Universal development workflow (branch naming, PR standards, mandatory first steps)
- Universal file structure requirements
- Universal metadata standards (enhanced YAML front matter)
- Project-specific extension guidelines
- Governance framework (amendment process, compliance enforcement)
- README.md with project overview and quick start
- AGENTS.md with agent coordination guidelines
- Change log (this file)

### Context

The Pan Constitution was created to provide a consistent governance framework for all AI-agent-built projects. It extracts universal principles from the NeuroNarnia and AwayTomate projects, providing a baseline that all projects can inherit and extend.

The constitution is designed to be:
- **Universal** - Applies to all AI-agent-built projects
- **Flexible** - Projects extend with project-specific requirements
- **Explicit** - Clear, unambiguous language for AI agents
- **Traceable** - All decisions linked to documented principles
- **Enforceable** - Validation gates and human oversight

### Migration Notes

Projects adopting Pan Constitution v1.0.0 should:
1. Refactor their constitution to separate Pan-inherited and project-specific sections
2. Update `.specify/rules/*.mdc` files to use Pan + Project structure
3. Ensure all documentation uses enhanced YAML front matter
4. Implement universal file structure
5. Follow universal development workflow

### Known Limitations

- Pan-wide orchestrator rules (`.specify/rules/*.mdc`) not yet defined
- Pan-wide templates (`.specify/templates/*.md`) not yet defined
- Validation tools and scripts not yet implemented
- Migration guides for existing projects not yet written

These will be addressed in future releases.

## v1.1.1 - 2025-01-27

**Status:** Active  
**Initiative:** pan-governance-foundation

### Changed

- [MERGED] Constitution formatting improvements (smart quotes to straight quotes, em dashes to regular dashes)
- [MERGED] Deleted non-functional update workflow (`.github/workflows/update-pan.yml`)

### Added

- [MERGED] Created constitutional infrastructure files:
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` - Required PR template with constitutional fields
  - `profile.yaml` - Project-specific tool configurations and thresholds
  - `.specify/memory/cdl.md` - Constitution Decision Log for tracking constitutional decisions

### Context

The automated update workflow was too long and not working properly, so it was removed. Manual constitution updates were necessary to establish the required constitutional infrastructure. This change log entry documents the process deviation and creation of missing infrastructure files.

### Process Notes

- Process deviation documented in CDL-001
- Infrastructure files created to support future constitutional compliance
- Future updates will follow proper constitutional workflow
