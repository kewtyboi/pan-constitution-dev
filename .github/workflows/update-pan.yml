# Pan AI Project Constitution

This Constitution governs how AI agents **deliver development work** under a single Senior Responsible Person (SRP).  
It is **project-agnostic**: copy this file into a project and add stricter local rules **below the marker** without weakening the Core above it.

- **Normative style:** This document uses **MUST/SHOULD/MAY** (BCP-14 / RFC 2119/8174).
- **Scope:** Development delivery only (not production operations).
- **Canonical path:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

Every Standard includes a small machine block (**knobs**) so CI/agents can enforce it.

---

## Part I — Preface (non-normative)

- **Who this is for:** 100% AI-delivered projects with one human overseer (SRP). Scales up if needed.  
- **What’s in/out:** In: development governance and quality. Out: runtime ops, environments, SLAs, kill switches.  
- **Artefacts:**
  - **CDL (Constitution Decision Log):** records decisions **about this Constitution** (distinct from ADRs).
  - **`profile.yaml`:** project-specific tool choices and thresholds **without editing Core**.
  - **PR template:** machine-parsable fields required by the Bindings.

> Principles use **Roman numerals** (I, II, …) so “P1” never looks like a priority code.

---

## Part II — Core Principles (normative baseline)

> Core contains only MUST-level rules that change agent behaviour across **all** projects.  
> Tools/brands aren’t hard-coded; Pan defines stable **check names** and **script entrypoints** in *Part IV — Bindings*.

### I. Authority, Scope & Refusal

```yaml
# knobs:principle
id: PI
standards: ["A1","A2","A3","A4","A5","A6"]

A1 — SRP named (MUST).
Each repository MUST declare an SRP (name and contact).

# knobs:standard
id: "A1"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "frontmatter_key"
    file: "README.md"
    key: "srp"
ci:
  require_checks: ["meta-srp-present"]
failure_message: "SRP not declared."

A2 — Scope of action (MUST).
Agents MUST act only on repository artefacts (code/tests/docs/config templates); no runtime/infra/data operations.

# knobs:standard
id: "A2"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "tool_allowlist_mode"
    allowed_modes: ["repo_only"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["preflight-scope"]
failure_message: "Attempted non-repo action."

A3 — Parse-first (MUST).
Before edits, agents MUST read, in order: AGENTS.md → this Constitution + profile.yaml → root README.md → any docs referenced by acceptance criteria and any docs signposted from those.

# knobs:standard
id: "A3"
owner: "SRP"
evidence:
  - type: "preflight_log_has_hashes"
    files: ["AGENTS.md","constitution.md","profile.yaml","README.md"]
  - type: "preflight_reads_signposted_docs"
ci:
  require_checks: ["preflight-read"]
failure_message: "Preflight not recorded."

A4 — Refuse on ambiguity (MUST).
If SRP, linked issue, acceptance criteria, or required profile inputs are missing, agents MUST refuse and request them.

# knobs:standard
id: "A4"
owner: "SRP"
pr_template:
  require_fields: ["issue_link","acceptance_criteria"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["ticket-ac-check"]
failure_message: "Missing issue link or acceptance criteria."

A5 — History safety (MUST).
Agents MUST NOT force-push, rewrite mainline history, or delete branches without a single-use explicit SRP instruction naming branch and intent.

# knobs:standard
id: "A5"
owner: "SRP"
ci:
  merge_gate:
    forbid_force_push: true
    require_field_reference: "explicit_instruction"
failure_message: "No explicit SRP instruction for history change."

A6 — Order of operations (MUST).
For each change:
	1.	Create branch [type]/[initiative]-[issue]-[slug].
	2.	Capture Prompt Snapshot Lite before first code commit (goal, constraints, notable risks).
	3.	TDD commits: fail → pass → refactor.
	4.	Open draft PR early; link issues; add provenance.
	5.	Run AI reviewer; address notes.
	6.	SRP review; explicit instruction recorded; merge.

# knobs:standard
id: "A6"
owner: "SRP"
pr_template:
  require_fields: ["prompt_snapshot_lite"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["review:agent","tests-pass"]
failure_message: "Missing early prompt snapshot or AI review."

  require_fields: ["issue_link","principles_standards"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["pr-has-links"]
failure_message: "PR missing issue link or standards mapping."

T2 — Constitution Decision Log (CDL) (MUST).

# knobs:standard
id: "T2"
owner: "SRP"
pr_template:
  optional_field: "cdl_link"
ci:
  require_checks: ["cdl-when-needed"]

# knobs:standard
id: "T3"
owner: "SRP"
pr_template:
  require_fields: ["model_version","prompt_hash_or_intent"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["provenance-present"]
failure_message: "Missing AI provenance."

T4 — CHANGELOG lifecycle (MUST).
Use a simple PR-driven log:

# CHANGELOG
## YYYY-MM-DD
- [MERGED] PR #123 → Issue #98 — "Title" (initiative: foo)
- [OPEN]   PR #140 → Issue #131 — "Title" (initiative: foo)

	•	On PR open: add an [OPEN] line under today’s date.
	•	On merge: flip that line to [MERGED] (same line).
	•	Newest date first.

pr_template:
  require_fields: ["tdd_summary"]
ci:
  require_checks: ["tests-pass"]
failure_message: "No evidence of test-first path."

If code talks to external APIs/SDKs, contract tests MUST exist/update (stubs/mocks allowed).

# knobs:standard
id: "E2"
owner: "SRP"
ci:
  require_checks: ["contract-tests"]
failure_message: "Missing or obsolete contract tests."

E3 — Docs with code (MUST).

failure_message: "Coverage below target without SRP approval."

E6 — New dependency/SDK (MUST).

⸻

Part III — Conformance (what “Pan-conformant” means)
	•	Pan Core: All Core MUST checks pass on protected branches; Core above marker is unmodified.
	•	Pan Core+: Core + all declared project-extension MUST checks pass.

Optional integrity check:

# knobs:standard
id: "I1"
owner: "SRP"

  - type: "pan_core_hash_matches"

  require_checks: ["pan-core-integrity"]
failure_message: "Pan Core modified; add changes as extensions below the marker."

Part IV — Bindings (stable interfaces, tool-agnostic)

What this section is: A stable API you (the agent) can execute without guessing.
Your job: Discover the bound commands, decide which checks apply for this change, run them, and make them pass.

IV-A. Invocation contract (how to run a check)

For each reserved check name (e.g., docs:frontmatter), invoke in this order:
	1.	package script — if package.json has the script: npm run <check-name>
	2.	make target — else if Makefile has a target: make <check-name>
	3.	profile mapping — else if profile.yaml.tools.scripts.<check-name> exists: run that shell command.
	4.	refuse & scaffold — if none exist: refuse and propose adding the missing alias.

IV-B. Required script entrypoints (must exist)
	•	docs:frontmatter:dry (validate; no writes)
	•	docs:frontmatter (apply schema/order; writes)
	•	docs:index (generate docs/INDEX.md)

IV-C. Discovery order
	1.	AGENTS.md → 2. this Constitution → 3. profile.yaml → 4. README.md → 5. signposted docs.

IV-D. Applicability mapping (changeset → checks)
	•	Any PR → pr-has-links, provenance-present, review:agent
	•	Docs changes → docs:*, lint:md, check:links, spellcheck, docs-delta
	•	Code changes → fmt, lint, tests-pass, coverage, check:changelog
	•	External calls/SDKs → contract-tests, license-scan, sec-scan
	•	Deps → deps-locked, sbom, license-scan
	•	Schemas/fixtures/logging → privacy-checklist
	•	Governance edits → require explicit_instruction
	•	Any repo → codeowners-present, constitution-location

IV-E. Execution flow (agent run-book)

Preflight → Branch & snapshot → TDD → Docs & index → Draft PR → Checks & review → Request merge (explicit SRP instruction).

IV-F. Pass/fail semantics

Exit 0 + artefact updated where applicable (e.g., docs:index writes docs/INDEX.md).

IV-G. Reserved CI check names

preflight-read, preflight-scope, docs:frontmatter:dry, docs:frontmatter, docs:index, lint:md, check:links, spellcheck, tests-pass, contract-tests, coverage, fmt, lint, sec-scan, license-scan, deps-locked, sbom, review:agent, pr-has-links, provenance-present, cdl-when-needed, privacy-checklist, injection-tests, check:changelog, codeowners-present, constitution-location, docs-delta
(optional) pan-core-integrity
